React shopping cart - Check the site live on - https://iridescent-puffpuff-9ebe12.netlify.app

This app is often asked to be built in React machine round interview - interviewer asks to build cart functionality using React - Candidate can either use API endpoint to get products list or create a json file - candidate needs to ask the interviewer if any dummy endpoint can be used for the same - I have built this just to show the functionality - so I have not made it responsive
